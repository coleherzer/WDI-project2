### Overview: 
Health Log is an app that allows users to keep track of personal health related information. Health Log utilizes a basic calendar system to allow its users to log information regarding their health (specifically diet and fitness). Health Log also allows users to set and track personal goals, allowing them to ensure healthier lifestyles. These features allow users to see just how good or bad they have been about diet and exercise, while also setting goals for the future.

### Approach:
I started out with the desire to build Health Log, with some basic features that would allow users to clearly keep track of health-related information. I used Trello to set up a work flow, and a simple notepad to diagram the app's models.
