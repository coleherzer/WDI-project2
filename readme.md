### Overview: 
Health Tracker is an app that allows users to keep track of personal health related information. Health Tracker utilizes a basic calendar system to allow its users to log information regarding their health (specifically diet and fitness). Health Tracker also allows users to set and track personal goals, allowing them to ensure healthier lifestyles. These features allow users to see just how good or bad they have been about diet and exercise, while also setting goals for the future.
